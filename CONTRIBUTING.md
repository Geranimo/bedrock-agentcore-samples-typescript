# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore TypeScript Samples! Whether it's a bug report, new example, correction, or additional documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests.

> **Note**: For AI agent-specific development patterns and guidelines, see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 20.0.0 or higher
- **npm**: Version 9.0.0 or higher
- **AWS CLI**: Configured with appropriate credentials
- **Access to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore**: Required for running examples

### Setup

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd bedrock-agentcore-samples-typescript
   npm install
   ```

2. Verify your setup by running validation:
   ```bash
   npm run validate  # Runs formatting and linting checks
   ```

3. Configure AWS credentials:
   ```bash
   export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
   # Use AWS credential provider chain (environment variables, IAM roles, or AWS config)
   ```

## Testing Examples

Each example should be independently runnable. To test an example:

```bash
cd primitives/runtime/hosting-agent/strands
npm install
npm start
```

## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check existing open, or recently closed, issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of the SDK being used
* Node.js and npm versions
* AWS region and service configuration
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment

## Contributing via Pull Requests

Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the *main* branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted.

To send us a pull request, please:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch from `main`.
3. Make your changes following the guidelines in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
4. Run validation checks:
   ```bash
   npm run validate  # Format and lint checks
   ```
5. Ensure all examples are runnable and include proper documentation.
6. Update relevant README files at all levels of the hierarchy.
7. Commit to your fork using clear, conventional commit messages.
8. Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.
9. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation.

### Pull Request Requirements

- **Code quality**: ESLint passes with no errors
- **Documentation**: Clear README files for all examples
- **Formatting**: Prettier formatting applied consistently
- **Runnable examples**: All examples must work with documented setup steps
- **Conventional commits**: Use conventional commit message format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.)

GitHub provides additional documentation on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and
[creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

## Adding New Examples

### Example Structure

Each example should be **self-sufficient** with the following structure:

```
primitives/runtime/your-example/
├── src/index.ts        # Entry point using BedrockAgentCoreApp
├── package.json        # Dependencies
├── tsconfig.json       # TypeScript config
├── Dockerfile          # Container build (optional)
├── docker-compose.yaml # Local development (optional)
├── Makefile            # Build, deploy, delete commands (optional)
├── template.yaml       # CloudFormation template (optional)
└── README.md           # Documentation (required)
```

### Code Style

- **Keep it simple** - samples should be easy to understand
- **Self-documenting code** - use clear variable and function names
- **Minimal comments** - only when the logic is non-obvious
- **Follow AGENTS.md** - adhere to all guidelines in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)
- **Modern TypeScript** - use latest stable features (ES modules, async/await)
- **Explicit types** - leverage TypeScript's type system

### README Format

Each example README should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Example Title

One-line description of what this example demonstrates.

|                         |         |
| ----------------------- | ------- |
| **AgentCore component** | Runtime/Identity/Tools |
| **Framework**           | Strands/Vercel AI/etc |

## What This Example Demonstrates

- Key feature 1
- Key feature 2
- Key feature 3

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- AWS CLI configured
- Access to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore

## Setup

\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`

## Running the Example

\`\`\`bash
npm start
\`\`\`

## How It Works

Brief explanation of the implementation.
```

### Documentation Requirements

When adding or updating examples:

1. **Update parent READMEs** - Ensure all parent directories reference the new example
2. **Consistent terminology** - Use the same terms as other examples
3. **Complete setup instructions** - Include all prerequisites and steps
4. **Test from scratch** - Verify the example works in a clean environment

## Finding contributions to work on

Looking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute on. As our projects, by default, use the default GitHub issue labels (enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix), looking at any 'help wanted' issues is a great place to start.
